    <string name = "helpIntroduction">
        This memory game consists in turning up a pair of cards of the same type.
        If the cards are the same, they stay turned up, otherwise they turn back down.
    </string>


    <string name = "helpDetails">
        The factors that change the game behaviour are time and difficulty.
        Time is at the top of the screen and represents the period of time that the player takes to find all the pairs.
        Difficulty is chosen at the menu screen, changes the amount of cards from 6 to 8 or 9 at easy, medium or hard respectively.
        The points are given in function of how much time takes to find the pairs, and you get a slightly more amount of points for each group of three cards found in hard mode.
